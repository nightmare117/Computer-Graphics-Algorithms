# Computer Graphics Algorithms in C++ with GLUT

This repository contains C++ implementations of fundamental computer graphics algorithms, including DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer), Bresenham's Line Algorithm, Bresenham's Circle Algorithm, Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm, Rotational Midpoint Ellipse, and the Scan Line Polygon Algorithm. These algorithms are commonly used in computer graphics for tasks like drawing lines, circles, ellipses, and filling polygons.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use or contribute to this project, you should have the following installed on your system:

- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- GLUT Library (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nightmare117/Graphics-Algorithms.git
- Compile the cpp files using your C++ compiler

## Usage
There are seperate cpp files for each algorithm. You can run any fiile and it may require some inputs from the user.

## Algorithm Included
- **DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) Line Drawing Algorithm:** This algorithm draws a line segment between two given points.
- **Bresenham's Line Algorithm:** An efficient algorithm for drawing lines.
- **Bresenham's Circle Algorithm:** Used for drawing circles.
- **Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm:** Draws ellipses based on user input.
- **Rotational Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm:** Draws rotated ellipses, allowing for arbitrary orientations.
- **Scan Line Polygon Algorithm:** Fills a polygon defined by its vertices using the scan line algorithm.
